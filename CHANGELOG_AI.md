### Added `handleBookTeeTime(game)` — `src/app.js`

Added the missing function body for the "⛳ Book Tee Time" button that already existed in the game detail view. The modal lets the creator select holes (9/18), cart count, fetch available tee time slots from the MTBogd API, pick a slot, and confirm the booking. On success, `bookingCode`, `bookingId`, and `bookingSlotId` are saved to the game via `store.saveGame` and the view re-renders.

Claude Code

### Changed Files
- `src/config.js`
- `src/booking.js` (new)
- `src/app.js`
- `src/i18n.js`

### Summary
MTBogd Golf Course booking integration (preview channel only — not yet merged to main). Three parts:
1. **`src/booking.js`** — API helpers for MTBogd public guest endpoints: `getPublicSettings()`, `getTeeTimes(date, players, holes)`, `createHold(slotId, players, holes, cartCount)`, `confirmBooking(holdId, customer, players, notes)`.
2. **Game creation tee-time picker** — when "Sky Resort Golf Club" is selected, a section appears with holes (9/18), cart count, and "Боломжит цаг харах" button. Slots load from MTBogd API; selecting one auto-fills the time. On game submit: hold is created → booking confirmed → `bookingCode`/`bookingId`/`bookingSlotId` stored in the game. Booking code shown in game detail for creator.
3. **Standalone booking view** (`#/booking`) — date / players / holes / cart pickers, slot grid, customer name+phone+notes form, booking confirmation with code display. Linked from home screen hero button.

### Risk
Medium. New external API dependency (MTBogd Cloud Functions). No changes to Firebase data model for existing games. Booking fields (`bookingCode` etc.) are additive. Preview channel URL: https://golfup-app--mtbogd-preview-v3mu79tt.web.app

Track meaningful AI-assisted changes here so work done across two PCs and multiple tools stays understandable.

### Tool
Claude Code

### Branch
claude/beldey-nguk4

### Changed Files
- `src/app.js`
- `src/i18n.js`

### Summary
Game history/archive lifecycle. Past games now stay in the "History" section for 7 days, then move to a new collapsible "Archive" section on the home screen (computed by date — no data model or background job changes). Past and archived games can no longer be deleted: the delete button is hidden on past games and `handleDelete` guards against deleting any game whose start time has passed. Added `gameArchive` / `noArchive` / `cannotDeletePast` i18n keys (MN/EN/KR).

### Risk
Low. Additive UI section + delete guard; no data model change.

### Summary
Added shared AI workflow notes and separate tool-specific instructions for Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini/Antigravity. Documented Git workflow, architecture, product concepts, and backlog.

### Risk
Low. Documentation-only change.
