# CHANGELOG_AI.md

Track meaningful AI-assisted changes here so work done across two PCs and multiple tools stays understandable.

## 2026-06-02

### Tool
Claude Code

### Branch
claude/beldey-nguk4

### Changed Files
- `src/app.js`
- `src/i18n.js`

### Summary
Game history/archive lifecycle. Past games now stay in the "History" section for 7 days, then move to a new collapsible "Archive" section on the home screen (computed by date — no data model or background job changes). Past and archived games can no longer be deleted: the delete button is hidden on past games and `handleDelete` guards against deleting any game whose start time has passed. Added `gameArchive` / `noArchive` / `cannotDeletePast` i18n keys (MN/EN/KR).

### Risk
Low. Additive UI section + delete guard; no data model change.

## 2026-05-21

### Tool
Codex

### Branch
main

### Changed Files
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CODEX.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `PROJECT_NOTES.md`
- `TASKS.md`
- `CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### Summary
Added shared AI workflow notes and separate tool-specific instructions for Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini/Antigravity. Documented Git workflow, architecture, product concepts, and backlog.

### Risk
Low. Documentation-only change.
